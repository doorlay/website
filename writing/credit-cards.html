        <p><em>TLDR: assuming you can spend $4,000 over a three month period, open up the Chase Freedom Unlimited, Chase Freedom Flex, and the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit cards. Use the Freedom Flex for whatever categories are in the 5% bonus, the Sapphire Preferred for dining and travel, and the Freedom Unlimited for everything else. Transfer all points to the Sapphire Preferred and redeem them for travel, where they’re all worth 1.25x their value.</em></p>

            Friends often ask me which credit cards I use and why, as I’ve garnered a bit of a reputation for abusing the credit card system for my own benefit. No, I don’t hang out on credit card churning forums or anything of that sort; I’m a big believer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>, so I try to get as much value out of my cards with as little effort as possible. Since starting to use this credit card system in August of 2022, I’ve earned 211,536 travel points, redeemed those for $2,644 in travel credit, and taken 12 fully or partially paid-for round-trip flights, two of which were international. I’ve spent $285 in annual fees during this time, so I’d say I’ve come out ahead.

            The credit card system I use is a path so well-traveled it has a name - the “Chase Trifecta”, consisting of the Chase Freedom Unlimited, Chase Freedom Flex, and Chase Sapphire Preferred. Each of these cards brings something to the table. The Freedom Flex earns 5% cash back on rotating categories (up to a limit); the Freedom Unlimited earns 3% cash back on dining and drugstores and 1.5% on everything else; the Sapphire Preferred earns 3% on dining and 2% on travel, while having a $95 annual fee.

            If the Sapphire Preferred sounds lame, especially considering it’s the one card with an annual fee, it’s because its biggest benefit is actually in how you can redeem points - at 1.25x their value toward travel. The real beauty of this system then lies in the ability to transfer points between cards within the Chase ecosystem, meaning you can earn points at 5% cash back on your Freedom Flex (or 3% on your Freedom Unlimited) and transfer these points to your Sapphire Preferred, redeeming them at 1.25x their value for travel. This raises your effective cash back from 5% to 6.25%, 3% to 3.75%, or 1.5% to 1.875%.

            Many people are hesitant to open up a card with an annual fee, which is understandable. Let me ease your worries. If you spend $4,000 on your Sapphire Preferred within the first three months of opening it, you will earn 60,000 points, or $750 to spend on travel. That more than pays for the $95 annual fee for a very long time. Even better, this bonus can even be recycled every 48 months, or four years, if you close and re-open the card.

            If you don’t think you can spend $4,000 on a credit card within a three month period, you likely do not spend enough money to justify the Sapphire Preferred’s annual fee. Ignoring the intro bonus, some back-of-the-envelope math has the break-even point anywhere from ~$29,000 to ~$33,000 of annual expenditure, depending on how much you spend on different categories and what kind of points you would be earning elsewhere. If you can’t spend $4,000 on a card within three months, you likely can’t spend $29,000 on a card within twelve, so you should probably use a different credit card setup.

            That’s about it. This system is as simple as it is effective, hence its popularity in the world of travel point maximizing. Outside of the “Chase Trifecta”, I occasionally will open up a credit card with a nice intro bonus and no annual fee – $200 cash back for $500 spend within a couple months is pretty common – just to get some free money, but that’s outside the scope of this explanation. Go forth and travel!
