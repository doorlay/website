            Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a big fan of Goodreads or similar social media-esque reading platforms. That said, I want to do a better job of tracking
            which books I'm reading, especially since I often read on an e-reader and don't have something physical to jog my memory.
            This page is a collection of all the books I've read, starting in 2025.

            2/3/2025 - Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker
        </p>
        <p class="book-description">
            Interesting book, not quite what I was expecting; much more of an emphasis on the scientific minutia of sleep as opposed to recommendations on how to sleep better. I guess the title should've gave it away, so that one's my fault. Definitely some interesting tid-bits of information in here, and some frightening statistics about sleeping while drowsy (which I already had strong opinions on). Worth a read if you're interesting in - you guessed it - why we sleep, but otherwise probably a bit too dense.

            1/20/2025 - The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons
        </p>
        <p class="book-description">
            A great wrap-up to the Hyperion story, although with a bit of a lull in the middle. I think Simmons may have gone a little far into the whole John Keats obsession, but I'm willing to ignore that given how much I enjoyed this series. A necessary read if you enjoyed Hyperion.

            1/3/2025 - Hyperion by Dan Simmons
        </p>
        <p class="book-description">
            One of the best fiction books I've read in years - a sort of Sci-Fi Canterbury Tales. I found the perspective changes to be a super refreshing way of reading a novel of this ambition, especially with how the different arcs intertwined with one another and built up a fully fleshed out world. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes Sci-Fi.
