            Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a big fan of Goodreads or similar social media-esque reading platforms. That said, I want to do a better job of tracking
            which books I'm reading, especially since I often read on an e-reader and don't have something physical to jog my memory.
            This page is a collection of all the books I've read, starting in 2025.
